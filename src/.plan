So, what do we really wanna make?
Just some game, I guess. But what do we really mean by that?
Some city simulator. But what does that mean, really?
I suppose a game that simulates a city. But really, what do we mean by that?
You're given some resources (or even none at all), and you build a building using them.
Each building requires different resources. Each building also consumes a different type of
resources over time.

So, here's some functionalities: 
- an inventory system.
- placing buildings.
- calculating city satisfaction rate.
- map
I guess that's enough for now.
Let's get to work.
