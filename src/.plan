Now that we've got the most important stuff out of the way, let's do the following:
State management.
Note: pressing ESC once cancels the state.

Press on the + button.
Available squares now have a plus on them.
Select which type of building you want (menu).
Click on the available squares.
Case 1:
    you can place a building.
    sub-case-1:
        there is already a building.
        ask if the player wants to override. 
        if so, override it.
    sub-case-2:
        just place the building.
Case 2:
    you can't place a building. 
    draw an X, and make a sound when trying to forcibly place.
for now, you can place a building anywhere.
I need to recharge my Chakra.
