What should our "simulator" be able to do? 

We'll implement the ability to edit the names of the houses last.
- Place a building 
This is by clicking the "plus button" on the GUI.
The GUI's state transforms to a "Select Building To Add" state.
In this state, the squares are not clickable. Select a building first.
After clicking on a building icon, the selected building icon is captured, and
the GUI's state becomes "Select A Square To Add To" state.
While in the "Select A Square To Add To" state, you can still choose another building. Capturing
still happens.
In this "Select A Square To Add To" state, you can select on any square to add a building to,
even if this square already has a building.
Case 0: there is no building. 
Add a building to our city, using the captured building type. 
This adds a building with a name of the form: {building_type}{id}.
The building_type is calculated from the building icon clicked. The ID is a global variable.
The square now has the ID of the building.

Case 1: there is a building. 
Using the building ID of the square, find the corresponding building in our city.
Then, change everything, besides its ID and name.

- Remove a building (removing a building from our city.) 
This is by clicking the "remove button" on the GUI.
The GUI's state becomes "Select Building To Remove".
Case 0: a square with a building is selected.
Find the corresponding building using the square's building ID, and remove it from the city.
Case 1: a square with no building is selected.
Do nothing.

-  View a building 
This is by clicking the "View Button" on the GUI.
The GUI's state becomes "Select Building To View".
Case 0: a square with a building is selected.
The GUI's state is: "Viewing Building".
Show a screen that has a picture of the building, next to which is a list of attributes of the
building.
You can only change the name.
Press ESC / right click to exit, which will change the state to "Select Building To View".
Case 1: a square without a building is selected.
Do nothing.

- View information about our city 
This is by clicking the "Settings Button" on the GUI.
The GUI's state becomes "View City Information".
It shows a menu that has all sorts of info about the city.

- Trigger random events. All an event does is simply modify the attributes of a simulation 
(the game class).  
Essentially, we're hardcoding stuff. 
Here are some events we will easily implement: 
- Night time. Precisely, we're modifying the tint color of our city texture.
- Dawn. Precisely, we're modifying the tint color of our city texture.
- Day. Precisely, we're modifying the tint color of our city texture.
- Parks increase satisfaction effect.
- Parks reduce pollution.
- Factories increase satisfaction effect.
- Factories increase pollution.
- Factories decrease satisfaction effect.
- Factories produce stuff.
- Factories consume stuff.
- Houses consume stuff.
- Parks consume stuff.
- The city's resources are consumed/increased. Afterwards, consumption/production is reset for
every building.
- Random homes are destroyed.
- Random parks are destroyed.
- Population increases.
- Population decreases.
- Check the satisfaction level of our city. If it is above a certain threshold, increase the 
city's surface. If this is too difficult, don't implement it.
Every 60 seconds, trigger a random event. This, too, is hardcoded.

Some pseudocode:

class Simulation
    Event m_event;
    void TriggerEvent(void) {
        m_event = GetRandomEvent();
        switch (m_event) {
            ...
            // modify stuff
        }
    }

What is a building?
A building has the following attributes:
m_id
m_name
m_type
m_satisfaction_effect
m_pollution_effect
m_consumed_water
m_consumed_electricity
m_produced_water
m_produced_electricity
m_inhabitant_count
m_inhabitant_capacity
We're giving up on inheritance, to reduce complexity.

What is a city?
A city has the following attributes:
m_name
m_building_list
m_satisfaction_level
m_pollution_level
m_population
m_total_water
m_total_electricity
m_total_water_consumption
m_total_electricity_consumption

Our game class contains a city, along with:
- mouse position
- relative mouse position
- and so on.
